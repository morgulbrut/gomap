# gomap

## Setup

### From source

Good old `go get -u github.com/morgulbrut/gomap` does the trick here.

### Binary

Just drop the binary according to your system somewhere in the path. 

Init a new map: `gomap -i` makes a new set of config files.

### Settings

`map.toml` sets up the map. 
`template.html` is the template for the map. 
`data.csv` contains the data.
 
## Usage

`gomap -h` gives some help.
